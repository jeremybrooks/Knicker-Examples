Knicker Examples

This project is designed to demonstrate how to use the Knicker library.

You can get the Knicker library here: http://github.com/knicker

Before you can use the sample code, you need to get an API key from Wordnik.
You can get a key here: http://developer.wordnik.com/

Once you have your key, you need to put it in a file called secret.properties
in the src directory. The file should look like this:

WORDNIK_API_KEY=your api key

The examples will load the key from this file and use it.

To build the examples, you need ant. Type ant -projecthelp to see the available
targets. Most likely all you will need to do is "ant run" to build and run the
project.

If you have any questions, you can contact me via email, twitter, or on the
Wordnik API mailing list.
